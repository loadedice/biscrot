biscrot
=======
*I like this name, it sounds like biscuit.*

This program is pretty simple, you do ./biscrot after installing img.bi's node.js library's modules (found here https://github.com/imgbi/imgbi-client/ ) --- by the looks of things to simplify the installation i'll need to set up a package.json and something else to make npm work magically. I'll learn all about that in the morning.
Oh yeah and it also uses yargs. Once I do get this set up to work properly i'll update this readme to be more helpful.

the program evokes scrot (scrot -s), so you need that installed too

drag over an area, and then it magically gets uploaded to img.bi. It uses xdg-open to open the link in your browser.


I honestly have no idea what i'm doing, I just like img.bi and my other script I used for uploading images in the way that this works stopped working because pomf.se was/is down.
